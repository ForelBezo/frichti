## Tech Question

Write automation code against www.frichti.co using one of the following web UI testing tool:
- Cypress
- TestCafe
- Puppeteer

### User Story
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to add a product to my cart from the Frichti Market catalog page, so that I will be able to checkout my grocery.

### Test flow
- As a first time visitor, go to www.frichti.co (no cookies, not logged in)
- Enter the address "168 rue saint-maur, 75011 Paris"
- Click on the first auto-completed value
- Once on the next page, click on the Frichti Market arrow to access Frichti Market
- Once on the catalog page, add to cart one product (by clicking on the plus sign in the product container)

---
**‚ö† NOTES:**
- not every product displayed on the catalog will be available, you must only add a product if available (if the plus sign is displayed)
- if the product becomes unavailable while adding it to cart, a red banner will appear, you don't need to handle this use case
- it's better to test your flow during service hours (between 9am and 9pm Paris time) otherwise, you'll get a warning stating that we are closed, and won't be able to add products to your cart

### Your answer
As part of your response email, you will need to include:
1. a zip of the source code of your tests
2. a video of your tests running (so we can see the code running on your local environment, in case we can't run it on our side)
