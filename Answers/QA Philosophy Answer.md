### QA Philosophy Question

Can you describe in a few sentences/bullet points what you think is an ideal QA team?

You can address topics, including but not limited to:
- How does the QA is integrated within the development life cycle? From a tech and a product standpoint?
- As part of a CI/CD pipeline, what should be tested, and when?
 

## Answer 

Among the qualities of QA in the teams are: 
- Anticipation : when the work starts before the software is built, review specifications, asks questions and challenges the product owners and developer's choices.
- Willing : At different Agile rituals and team meetings in the two sides Product and Tech so it can accumulate knowledge on the different functionalities available in the software and also the miscellaneous technical parts.
- communicative : communicates one of the major roles of the QA is giving feedback about software quality to different projects stakeholders
- Firm : when comes time for giving his recommendation at the end of a sprint, it is sometimes necessary to be firm because the QA must defend the requirement and the quality level to achieve, which had been established before the sprint (in frame of agile methodology) over which all of members of the project have agreed before delivering

Those qualities help the QA in his job and set him/her up in good position to help all people to work nicely for carrying out the project because the quality is the result of different things who come from each person and the product is the result of this collaboration.

Besides these key points, I think that the QA should be integrated in the whole development cycle from the specifications to shiping to production environment. Firstly, challenging product choices and speicifcations through asking relevant questions in order to make understanding unified of the features to develop. In the other hand, by communicating with developers about unit and integration tests coverage in order to enhance end to end automated tests coverage and avoid redundancy. Then comes the critical and final part, by testing what was developed and giving feedback untill the production deployment. Finally by monitoring production activity to ensure what was shipped is working properly for the end user.
 
In the context of a CI/CD pipeline, we have many options to include the QA in the process. 
The main goal is to ensure that the new developpement does not introduce regressions in the existing feature. 
This is the reason the e automated tests should be triggered after the software build finished. 
Generally, those are executed in a testing environment and reports are published to inform all the team of the test results.

Therefore, the QA is the guarantor of quality level to reach, for that, the QA has to lead  all development cell toward the decision taken before about the requirement  and to keep in this direction for the good of all beacause  the quality is the concern of the whole company. For that, the quality impacts the reputation of the company  and this reputation vis-Ã -vis its customers which may tarnish its image, the final result might be the  loss or even the fall in turnover.
The final decision does not belong to the QA but he/she could advise and help the decision-making with his/her product's vision which is built during the test activities carried out from design to development

## Feedback

During this test in the part of automation I noticed the lack of idUnique and data test that we could use like locator in order to design more easier and efficient test.
The QA is essential inside of the team because his reporting is useful to scale up the whole quality before and after to ship to production
