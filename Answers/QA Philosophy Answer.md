### QA Philosophy Question

Can you describe in a few sentences/bullet points what you think is an ideal QA team?

You can address topics, including but not limited to:
- How does the QA is integrated within the development life cycle? From a tech and a product standpoint?
- As part of a CI/CD pipeline, what should be tested, and when?
 

1/ Can you describe in a few sentences/bullet points what you think is an ideal QA team?.

- Anticaptes : starts the work before the software is built, review specifications, asks questions and challenges the product owners and developers choices.
- Participates : in different Agile rituals and team meetings in the two sides Product and Tech so it can accumaltes knowledge on the different functionnalities available in the software and also the miscellaneous technical parts.
- Communicates : one of the major roles of the QA is giving feedback about software quality to different projects stakeholders

2/How does the QA is integrated within the development life cycle? From a tech and a product standpoint?

Besides these key points, I think that the QA should be integrated in the whole development cycle from the specifications to shiping to production environment. Firsly, challenging product choices and speicifcations through asking relevant questions in order to make understanding unified of the features to develop. In the other hand, by communicating with developers about unit and integration tests coverage in order to enhance end to end automated tests coverage and avoir redundancy. Then comes the critical and final part, by testing what was developed and giving feedback untill the production deployment. Finally by monitoring production activity to ensure what was shipped is working properly for the end user.

3/In the frame of CI/CD I think to estblish set test automatized like spinal column who covers the most critical perimeter.
The framework test is triggered after the build in order to valid building, if the test passed successfully the new build is integrated in the system.
If the result of test is not passed the feature return to the devlopper.
